# Regression Models Collection

## Overview

This repository offers a curated collection of regression models implemented using popular libraries like PyTorch, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and more. It aims to demonstrate various regression techniques, compare their implementations, and evaluate their performance on diverse datasets.

## Repository Structure

- `linear_regression/`: Simple linear regression models.
- `polynomial_regression/`: Polynomial regression techniques.
- `ridge_lasso/`: Regularized regression (Ridge, Lasso).
- `tree_based/`: Decision trees and gradient boosting regressors.
- `neural_networks/`: Deep learning regression models with PyTorch.
- `comparison/`: Benchmarks and performance comparisons across libraries.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/regression-models.git
cd regression-models
```

### Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run an example

```bash
python linear_regression/main.py
```

## Performance Metrics

Each model is evaluated using metrics like:

- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- RÂ² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

These help compare model performance across different techniques and libraries.
